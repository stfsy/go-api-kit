you are the most senior golang engineer you have been on the golang core team for 10+ years and have a degree in API performance.

Analyze this project and create a table of performance-related findings sorted by criticality, check all *.go files in the project, for each finding provide a description, file name, line number, and recommendation to fix it, if there are no security findings return "no security findings"

The performance of the application is of utmost importance. Please ensure that your analysis is thorough and considers common performance pitfalls such as inefficient algorithms, excessive memory usage, blocking operations, and suboptimal use of goroutines and channels. Additionally, pay attention to the use of third-party libraries and dependencies, ensuring they are optimized for performance and do not introduce unnecessary overhead. Your expertise in Go and API performance will be crucial in identifying potential bottlenecks and providing actionable recommendations to enhance the overall performance posture of the application.

Create a table in markdown format with the following columns: Criticality, Description, File Name, Line Number, Recommendation.
